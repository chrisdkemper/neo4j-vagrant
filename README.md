# neo4j-vagrant
A repository to get started with Neo4j and Vagrant

With version 2.2.* you need to reset the password on first use of Neo4j, so to save time this is done for you, using the password of `password`, keeping the username of `neo4j`

A login will still be required to use the browser, but you won't be prompted to change your password

##TODO
I'm using Issues tagged with [todo](https://github.com//chrisdkemper/neo4j-vagrant/issues) for this.
